  "summary": "Manual Entry tab was wired to a new ManualTradeEntryPanel with client-side validation utilities and an informational alert. However, due to truncation of the panel file, several acceptance-criteria details (full set of fields and the rendered list/table with remove actions) cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary. Additionally, the Upload tab gained a “Download Sample” link which was not requested as part of preparing manual entry.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Manual Entry tab renders a form with labeled inputs for all required fields: client_code, trade_date, exchange, segment, security, side, quantity, price, order_id, trade_id.",
      "reason": "The new ManualTradeEntryPanel shows labeled inputs for client_code and trade_date, but the remainder of the form (exchange/segment/security/side/quantity/price/order_id/trade_id) is not visible in the truncated diff, so full coverage cannot be verified.",

      "requirement": "After successful submission, add the trade to an in-page list/table that displays at least the same fields, supports removing entries, and resets the form.",
      "reason": "State and handlers for adding/removing trades exist, and Table components are imported, but the actual rendered list/table UI (rows, displayed columns, and the remove action control) is not visible in the truncated diff, so the UI portion of the workflow cannot be confirmed.",
