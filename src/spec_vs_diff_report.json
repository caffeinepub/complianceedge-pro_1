  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented via a new AdminEmailMismatchBanner and conditional logic in App.tsx/DashboardLayout to show a persistent warning when the saved profile email is not exactly the bootstrap admin email. REQ-2 is partially implemented in ProfileSetupDialog, but the email comparison uses trimming, which violates the requirement/constraint to keep the comparison exact with no normalization changes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "In ProfileSetupDialog, determine mismatch using an exact, case-sensitive comparison to \"sanjeev.vohra@gmail.com\" with no normalization/casing changes in the UX logic.",
      "reason": "The diff uses `email.trim()` for both `isAdminEmail` and `showEmailHint` gating, which changes the comparison semantics and violates the stated constraint of no normalization changes.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/auth/ProfileSetupDialog.tsx (uses `const isAdminEmail = email.trim() === ADMIN_EMAIL;` and `const showEmailHint = email.trim() !== '';`)"
