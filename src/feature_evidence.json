This must (a) grant the caller admin privileges in backend authorization checks that rely on `AccessControl.isAdmin(...)` and (b) ensure the stored `UserProfile.extendedRole` for that principal is set to \"Super Admin\" so the frontend capability system (e.g., `manage_users`, `manage_config`) is enabled for that user.",
